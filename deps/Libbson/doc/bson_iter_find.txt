NAME

bson_iter_find, bson_iter_find_case, bson_iter_find_descendant - advance a bson_iter_t to a given element


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------------------
#include <bson.h>

bool
bson_iter_find (bson_iter_t *iter,
                const char  *key);

bool
bson_iter_find_case (bson_iter_t *iter,
                     const char  *key);

bool
bson_iter_find_descendant (bson_iter_t *iter,
                           const char  *dotkey,
                           bson_iter_t *descendant);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _bson_iter_find()_ function shall advance _iter_ to the element named _key_ or exhaust all elements of _iter_.
If _iter_ is exhausted, FALSE is returned and _iter_ should be considered invalid.

The _bson_iter_find_case()_ function shall advance _iter_ to the element named _key_ while ignoring case-sensitivity or exhaust all element of _iter_.
If _iter_ is exhausted, FALSE is returned and _iter_ should be considered invalid.

The _bson_iter_find_descendant()_ function shall follow standard MongoDB dot notation to recurse into subdocuments.
_descendant_ will be initialized and advanced to the descendant.
If FALSE is returned, both _iter_ and _descendant_ should be considered invalid.


RETURN VALUE
------------

TRUE is returned if the requested key was found. If not, _iter_ was exhausted and should now be considered invalid.


ERRORS
------

FALSE is returned if the requested key could not be found.
