SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------------------
#include <bson.h>

#define BSON_ITER_HOLDS_DBPOINTER(iter) \
   (bson_iter_type ((iter)) == BSON_TYPE_DBPOINTER)

void
bson_iter_dbpointer (const bson_iter_t *iter,
                     uint32_t          *collection_len,
                     const char       **collection,
                     const bson_oid_t **oid);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

BSON_TYPE_DBPOINTER is deprecated and should not be used in new code.

The _bson_iter_dbpointer()_ function shall retrieve the contents of a BSON_TYPE_DBPOINTER element. The DBPOINTER type is deprecated in the bson spec and should not be used in new code.

It is a programming error to call this function on elements that are not of type BSON_TYPE_DBPOINTER. This can be checked with _BSON_ITER_HOLDS_DBPOINTER()_.
