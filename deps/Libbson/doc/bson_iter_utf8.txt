NAME
----

bson_iter_utf8 - retrieve a utf8 element from a bson document


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------------------
#include <bson.h>

#define BSON_ITER_HOLDS_UTF8(iter) \
   (bson_iter_type ((iter)) == BSON_TYPE_UTF8)

const char *
bson_iter_utf8 (const bson_iter_t *iter,
                uint32_t          *length);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _bson_iter_utf8()_ function shall retrieve the contents of a BSON_TYPE_UTF8 element currently observed by _iter_.

It is invalid to call this function while ovserving an element other than BSON_TYPE_UTF8.


RETURN VALUE
------------

A UTF-8 encoded string that has not been modified or freed.

It is suggested that the caller validate the content is valid UTF-8 before using this in other places. That can be done by calling _bson_utf8_validate()_ or validating the underlying _bson_t_ before iterating it.


ERRORS
------

No errors are defined.
