NAME
----

bson_destroy - release resources of an allocated bson_t


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------------------
#include <bson.h>

void
bson_destroy (bson_t *bson);

uint8_t *
bson_destroy_with_steal (bson_t   *bson,
                         bool      steal,
                         uint32_t *length);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _bson_destroy()_ function shall free an allocated _bson_t_ structure.

This function should always be called when you are done with a _bson_t_ unless
otherwise specified.


The _bson_destroy_with_steal()_ function shall destroy a _bson_t_ structure but
return the underlying buffer instead of freeing it. If steal is false, this is
equivalent to calling bson_destroy(). It is a programming error to call this
function on a _bson_t_ that is not a top-level _bson_t_, shuch as those
initialized with _bson_append_document_begin()_, _bson_append_array_begin()_,
and _bson_writer_begin()_.


RETURNS
-------
_bson_destroy_with_steal()_ shall return a buffer containing the contents of
the _bson_t_ if _steal_ is non-zero. This should be freed with _bson_free()_
when no longer in use. _length_ will be set to the length of the bson document
if non-NULL.

ERRORS
------

No errors are defined.
