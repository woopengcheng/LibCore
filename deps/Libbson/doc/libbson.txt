NAME
----

libbson - cross-platform BSON document library


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-------------------
#include <bson.h>
--------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Libbson is a cross-platform library designed to simplify the process of
creating, parsing, and manipulating BSON documents.


STRUCTURES
----------

bson_t
~~~~~~

`bson_t` represents a BSON document. This structure manages the underlying BSON
encoded buffer. For mutable documents, it can append new data to the document.

See linkbson:bson_t[3] for more information.

bson_oid_t
~~~~~~~~~~

`bson_oid_t` represents a 12-byte BSON ObjectId.

See linkbson:bson_oid_t[3] for more information on the contents of this
structure.


bson_iter_t
~~~~~~~~~~~

`bson_iter_t` allows iteration, one key at a time, through a BSON document.

See linkbson:bson_iter_t[3] for more information on this structure.


bson_reader_t
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`bson_reader_t` provides an efficent interface to read a sequence of BSON
documents from either a file-descriptor or buffer. This is useful if you
are processing mongodump backups or incoming MongoDB packets.

See linkbson:bson_reader_t[3] for more information on this structure.

bson_writer_t
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`bson_writer_t` provides an efficient interface for encoding a sequence of
high-level documents into a single BSON encoded buffer. Such uses might include
converting an array of Python dictionaries into a MongoDB insert RPC.

See linkbson:bson_writer_t[3] for more information on this structure.


THREAD SAFETY
-------------

Libbson is not thread-safe, but is thread-aware. It is the responsibility of
the caller to ensure they are not using structures from multiple threads at the
same time. Libbson does not use internal or global state unless specified.
