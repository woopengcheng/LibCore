bson_iter_recurse(3)
====================


NAME
----

bson_iter_recurse - recurse into a sub-document or sub-array of a bson document


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------------------
#include <bson.h>

bool
bson_iter_recurse (const bson_iter_t *iter,
                   bson_iter_t       *child);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _bson_iter_recurse()_ function shall initialize _child_ using the embedded document or array currently observed by _iter_.

If there was a failure to initialize the _iter_, FALSE is returned and both _iter_ and _child_ should be considered invalid.

This should only be called when observing an element of type BSON_TYPE_ARRAY or BSON_TYPE_DOCUMENT.


RETURN VALUE
------------

TRUE if _child_ has been intialized.
Otherwise, both _child_ and _iter_ should be considered invalid.


ERRORS
------

FALSE could be returned if the sub-document length does not match what is expected by the parent document. This could happen if the document is corrupt or malicious.
