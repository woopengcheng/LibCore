NAME
----

bson_append_timestamp - append a timestamp element to a bson document


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------------------
#include <bson.h>

bool
bson_append_timestamp (bson_t     *bson,
                       const char *key,
                       int         key_length,
                       uint32_t    timestamp,
                       uint32_t    increment);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This function is not similar in functionality to _bson_append_date_time()_.
Timestamp elements are different in that they include only second precision and an increment field.
They are primarily used for intra-MongoDB server communication.

The _bson_append_timestamp()_ function shall append a new element of type BSON_TYPE_TIMESTAMP.


RETURN VALUE
------------

TRUE if successful. Otherwise FALSE and no modifications are made.


ERRORS
------

FALSE if there was insufficient space to append the element.
