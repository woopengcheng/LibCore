NAME

bson_iter_code, bson_iter_codewscope - retrieve javascript from a code element of a bson document


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------------------
#include <bson.h>

#define BSON_ITER_HOLDS_CODE(iter) \
   (bson_iter_type ((iter)) == BSON_TYPE_CODE)

#define BSON_ITER_HOLDS_CODEWSCOPE(iter) \
   (bson_iter_type ((iter)) == BSON_TYPE_CODEWSCOPE)

const char *
bson_iter_code (const bson_iter_t *iter,
                uint32_t          *length);

const char *
bson_iter_codewscope (const bson_iter_t *iter,
                      uint32_t          *length,
                      uint32_t          *scope_len,
                      const uint8_t    **scope);

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _bson_iter_code()_ function shall retrieve the JavaScript contents of an element of type BSON_TYPE_CODE.
You can check that a field is of type BSON_TYPE_CODE with _bson_iter_type()_ or _BSON_ITER_HOLDS_CODE()_.

The _bson_iter_codewscope()_ function acts similar to _bson_iter_code()_ except for BSON_TYPE_CODEWSCOPE elements. It also will provide a pointer to the buffer for scope, which can be loaded into a _bson_t_.


RETURN VALUE
------------

A UTF-8 encoded string that should not be modified or freed.
_length_ will be set to the length of the return value in bytes.


ERRORS
------

It is a programming error to call _bson_iter_code()_ on an element other than BSON_TYPE_CODE.

It is a programming error to call _bson_iter_codewscope()_ on an element other than BSON_TYPE_CODEWSCOPE.
