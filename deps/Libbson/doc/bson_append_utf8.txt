bson_append_utf8(3)
===================


NAME
----

bson_append_utf8 - append a UTF-8 encoded string to a bson document


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
-----------------------
#include <bson.h>

bool
bson_append_utf8 (bson_t     *bson,
                  const char *key,
                  int         key_length,
                  const char *value,
                  int         length);
-----------------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _bson_append_utf8()_ function shall append a UTF-8 encoded string to _bson_.

If _key_ is NULL terminated, -1 may be supplied for _key_length_.

If _value_ is NULL terminated, -1 may be supplied for _length_.

_value_ *MUST* be valid UTF-8.
Some UTF-8 implementations allow for '\0' to be contained within the string (excluding the termination '\0').
This is allowed, but remember that it could cause issues with communicating with external systems that do not support it.
We suggest using modified UTF-8 which uses a 2 byte representation for embedded '\0' within the string.


RETURN VALUE
------------

TRUE if successful. Otherwise FALSE and no modifications are made.


ERRORS
------

FALSE is returned if there was insufficient space to append the element.
